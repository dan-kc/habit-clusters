# Habit Clusters

A simple, yet hilariously overengineered habit checklist webapp that groups habits together by their reward.

Based on my personal habit workflow.

Minimum viable product - work in progress.

## Todo

- Show completed on previous days

- Add collapsed calendar for mobile
- Add optimistic ui for cluster highlight when all habits are complete
- Add tests for github login
