# Habit Clusters

A simple, yet hilariously overengineered habit tracking app that helps you organise your habits into groups based on their rewards.

## Why?

I've long been searching for an elegant solution to manage my daily habits. Despite not even having a super niche habit routine, I often find myself juggling multiple habit tracking apps in order to achieve what should really require just one.

Also, most habit tracking apps on the market are heavily gamified, which may work for some, but I personally prefer a more sophisticated and professional-looking UI that aligns with my mindset.

That's why I'm making Habit Clusters, as a solution to both of these gripes.

## Getting started

Getting started with Habit Clusters is a breeze. Simply create a cluster and give it a name based on the reward you'll earn upon completion. For example, you can create a cluster called 'Coffee' and add habits, such as doing some posture stretches or brushing your teeth, to complete before claiming your reward.

One of the best features of Habit Clusters is the availability window, allowing you to restrict the time of day when you can claim your reward. For instance, you can set a window from 7am to 2pm for your 'Coffee' cluster meaning that, if you complete the associated habits, you can indulge in as much coffee as you want during that timeframe, but only during that timeframe. This feature is perfect for implementing something like intermittent fasting, as you can set a window for your 'Food' cluster, controlling when you can claim your reward of food.

Other than 'Coffee' and 'Food', I personally have clusters for 'Video Games' and 'Phone'. This implements sensible restrictions on habits that I wish to do less often, while also compelling me to complete habits that I wish to do more often.

Give it a go, let me know what clusters you create!
