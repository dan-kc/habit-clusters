# Habit Clusters

A simple, yet hilariously overengineered habit checklist webapp that groups habits together by their reward.

Based on my personal habit workflow.

Minimum viable product - work in progress.

## Todo

- Rename things
- Add tests for calendar
- Stop checking if in time window for previous days
- Show completed on previous days

- Add collapsed calendar for mobile
- Add optimistic ui for cluster highlight when all habits are complete
- Add tests for github login
- Fix glitch when adding a new habit and typing the name, if you hit enter it deletes it.
