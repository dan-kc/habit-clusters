# Habit Clusters

A simple, yet hilariously overengineered habit checklist webapp that groups habits together by their reward.

Based on my personal habit workflow. 

Minimum viable product - work in progress.

## Todo

- Add tests for github login
- Add optimistic ui for cluster highlight when all habits are complete
- Add typesafety
- Remove is_complete and swap it for a date array
