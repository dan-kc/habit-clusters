# Habit Clusters

A simple, yet hilariously overengineered habit checklist web app that goes beyond the basics. It not only helps you track your habits, but also groups them together based on their rewards, allowing you to easily prioritize and focus on what matters most. 

## Why?

I have been searching for an elegant solution to manage my daily habits, but I find myself using multiple apps together for my use case, and constantly stretching their respective UIs to meet my specific needs. Most habit tracking apps available in the market are heavily gamified, which may work for some, but I personally prefer a more sophisticated and professional-looking UI that aligns with my mindset. That's why I created Habit Clusters, a minimalist and sleek web application that offers a refined user interface, perfect for those who value both functionality and aesthetics.

## Getting started

Getting started with Habit Clusters is a breeze. Simply create a cluster and give it a name based on the reward you'll earn upon completion. For example, you can create a cluster called 'Coffee' and add habits, such as washing your face or brushing your teeth, to complete before claiming your reward.

One of the standout features of Habit Clusters is the availability window, allowing you to restrict the time of day when you can claim your reward. For instance, you can set a window from 7am to 3pm for your 'Coffee' cluster, meaning that you can indulge in as much coffee as you want during that timeframe, but only during that timeframe. This feature is perfect for implementing intermittent fasting, as you can set a window for your 'Food' cluster, controlling when you can claim your reward of eating.

You get the gist. Other than 'Coffee' and 'Food', I personally have clusters for 'Video Games' and 'Phone'. This implements sensible restrictions on habits I'd like to do less, while also forcing me to complete habits I'd like to do more.

Give it a go, let me know what clusters you've created!
